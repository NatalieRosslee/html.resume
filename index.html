<h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I was born in Johannesburg, Gauteng. I grew up in Kroonstad, Free State and matriculated at Die Afrikaanse Hoërskool Kroonstad in 2016 with 3 distinctions. In 2017 I started my degree in Tourism Management at North-West University in Potchefstroom. After finishing my degree, I decided to do my Post-Graduate Certifications in Education for the FET phase with my main subjects: Tourism and Business Studies. </p>
    <p>I would summarise myself as a Christian, hard-working woman who is passionate about teaching especially Mathematics. I am registered to start my Certificate in teaching Mathematics in the FET phase in 2024. I always try to go the extra mile for any one of my students and see myself as an adventurous, ambitious young lady. My dream goal is to help as many children with maths in South Africa through a selfbuild-platform.</p>
